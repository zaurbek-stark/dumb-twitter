# Dumb Twitter

This is the codebase for the Dumb Twitter app that I developed in this video. It's like a minimalistic version of Twitter where only dumb tweets are allowed, so that they don't come to pollute the regular Twitter app.

## Local development

Before starting this project, you will need to setup an OpenAI account and get a API key.

Then create a `.env` file and put that key there:
`REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

You can now start this project by running the following command from the root folder:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
